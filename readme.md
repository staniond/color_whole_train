# Color whole train

**Color the whole train by the destination train stop color, not just the locomotives!**

This mod colors all the train carriages with the color of the stop this train is currently going to.
This behaves the same way as the 'Use destination train stop color' setting in locomotives, but
colors the whole train.

This mod colors the train if **at least one** locomotive has this setting on. Otherwise it does not touch the train.

It should be safe to add/remove this mod from any save.

## IMPORTANT

In order to make fluid wagon colors work, install also the 'Fluid Wagon Color Mask' mod.
Vanilla fluid wagons cannot be colored. (it is an optional dependency if you do not want to have colored fluid wagons).

## Mod compatiblity

- integrated with Project Cybersyn - works out of the box for both cybersyn and vanilla trains on the same save.
- works out of the box with the 'Vibrant Train Colors' if you like, well, more vibrant train colors.
- works out of the box with the 'Train Trails' mod.

## Notes

If you do not set a custom color of the train stop and leave it at default,
the whole train will also be set to default color (all wagons will be set to colorless).
