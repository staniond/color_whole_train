# Color whole train

**Color the whole train by the destination train stop color, not just the locomotives!**
**Manually changing locomotive color will also color all wagons!**

This mod colors all the train carriages with the color of the stop this train is currently going to.
This behaves the same way as the 'Use destination train stop color' setting in locomotives, but
colors the whole train.

This mod colors the train if **at least one** locomotive has this setting on. Otherwise it does not touch the train.

Manually changing locomotive color will also color all wagons. The wagons will be recolored based on next station again if any locomotive has this setting enabled. If you just want to keep the color based on the locomotive, untick the 'Use destination train stop color' setting for all locomotives of the train.

It should be safe to add/remove this mod from any save.

UPS friendly. Should have almost zero impact on performance.

## IMPORTANT

In order to make fluid wagon colors work, install also the 'Fluid Wagon Color Mask' mod.
Vanilla fluid wagons cannot be colored. (it is an optional dependency if you do not want to have colored fluid wagons).

## Mod compatiblity

- works well with the 'Project Cybersyn' mod (recolors train even when new order is received out of depot and when going to a refueler).
- works well with the 'Vibrant Train Colors' if you like, well, more vibrant train colors.
- works well with the 'Train Trails' mod.
- should work out of the box with most other train mods (if not, notify me)

## Note

The mod colors only wagons if at least one locomotive has the 'Use destination train stop color' option set.
If you want to color the whole train, set this option on all locomotives, but you can have some locomotives not change colors if you want to.
